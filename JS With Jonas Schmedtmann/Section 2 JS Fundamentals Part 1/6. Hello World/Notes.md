# 6. Hello World

1. Different Ways to go to the Javacript log    
    A. **Keyboard Shortcut** - **Ctrl + Shift + J** (This is used to open the **JS Console**)    
    B. In order to open the **inspect element** - we use **Ctrl + Shift + I** (which is used to **inspect the element**) - This is for inspect element so it can be ignored(Just for our learning)  
    C. **Right click** on the page and **choose the inpect option**  
    D. Chrome Menu -> View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console
![Alert Method in Console](./images/JS%20Alert%20method%20on%20Console.png)
As you are able to see in the above image, we just wrote a simple **alert method** in order to display an alert notification in our window

![JS Conditional Alert method](./images/JS%20Conditional%20Alert%20Method.png)
Above we have declared a variable and we are comparing it with strict operator. If so it matches then we print the alert window
(OR ELSE)
The alert window won't be printed which is visible in the below image

**NOTE - We can also get to the previous command, we can also use the Up arrow and then get to the previous commands**      
**Also we can use this as a calculator**
