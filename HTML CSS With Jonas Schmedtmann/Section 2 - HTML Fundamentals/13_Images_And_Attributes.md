How to add images in a HTML webapge 

```HTML
  <img src="./laura-jones.jpg" alt="This is a post image" width="50" height="50">
  <img src="./post-img.jpg" alt="This is a post image" width="500" height="200">
```
1. The img element is a **special element** in HTML; because it **doesn't have a closing tag**
2. **Attributes** - These are nothing but pieces of data which we use to describe elements  
  -src - This element is used to specify the directory where the image is specified  
  -alt - This attribute stands for **alternative text**, this attribute shouldn't be skipped. We have to specify some text which describes what the image is about;     
  Basically the description of the image   
  -height - This is used to specify the height of the image   
  -width - This is used to specify the width of the image

3. Advantages of using this Alt attribute  
  -Search engines such as **Google Chrome** to know what is in the image   
  -By specifying the description of the image, we can also allow blind people to use our website 


  ```HTML
  <html lang="en"> - We specify the language that we use for this webpage
  ```

Character set that we use in this HTML Document
```HTML
  <meta charset="UTF-8" /> - UTF-8 is basically all the simple characters that we use in English Language
```
Meta tag - This basically describes the data about the data
Also this tag doesn't have any closing tag
