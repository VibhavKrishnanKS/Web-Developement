There are totally 6 types of heading tags in HTML

```HTML
<!-- Given below the green colour is how you perform a basic commenting in HTML -->
  <!-- Primary Heading -->
  <h1>The Basic language of the Web:HTML</h1>
  <!-- Secondary Heading -->
  <h2>The Basic language of the Web:HTML</h2>
  <!-- Tertiary Heading -->
  <h3>The Basic language of the Web:HTML</h3>
  <h4>The Basic language of the Web:HTML</h4>
  <h5>The Basic language of the Web:HTML</h5>
  <h6>The Basic language of the Web:HTML</h6>
```

**NOTE** - Each and Every page should have only one **PRIMARY HEADING**

Below shown is how you can Bold Elements in HTML
```HTML
<b>Laura Jones</b>
```
But it is not advised to use b tag in HTML cause it's an older one, because of this we move to the newer on which is strong   
**Reason** - b is simple an element without any semantical meaning
```HTML
<!-- New one which we have to use starting in HTML5 -->
<strong></strong>
```

similarly for italic font 
Older way - Which doesn't convey any semantical meaning 
```HTML
We can use i tag 
<i>functional</i>
```
But the new one which is the conventional one
```HTML
<!-- Here em refers to emphasize -->
<em>function</em>
```
