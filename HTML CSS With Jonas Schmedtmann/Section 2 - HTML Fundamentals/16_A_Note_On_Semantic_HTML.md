# 16. A Note on Semantic HTML 

### Certain elements have a meaning (or) a certain purpose attached to them 

1. When we think about a certain HTML element   
    1. We **shouldn't actually think** like about **what the element looks like** and **how the element is rendered in the webpage**
    2. But instead we **have to think** about **what the element actually means** and **what it stands for**    
> Simple example     
    1.1. When we use the bold tag we use **strong tag** instead of **b**, which adds a more semantic meaning that it is a **strong content** which is **very important**  
    1.2. instead of italic tag **i** we use **em** which mean **emphasize**  
    1.3. is also an example which is used to **create a box** - After HTML 5 we use dib only when we don't need to add any meaning for a certain container    
      1.3.1. Cause some of the elements in HTML can have a meaning associated with them - header,footer, p,etc...


**Benefits of Using Semantic HTML**
1. **Search Engine Optimization**:- Google will find it easy to understand what your content is all about and your webpage is all about    
2. **For Better Readability and Accesibility**:- Also Semantic HTML is easy for accessibility and for reading purpose - suppose say you write a code and you share it to other persons, even thay should be in a state to understand your code
